I love mindmaps. They help keep my methodology when doing security research or
brainstorming with my collegues. With that in mind I decided to spread some love
in the community by creating **MindAPI**.

Nowadays APIs are part of all modern applications. Creating something that could
help the security community to assess an API and at the same time help me by
keeping my work organized its a win-win.

MindAPI is a mindmap which combines years of experience in testing API security.
Its divided into two sections:

- Reconnaissance 
- Testing (Follows OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines and other security
  guides)

On both of them you have guidelines, links to open-source tools and
documentation that help you on the way.

It's **free**, **open-source** and
[open to contributions](https://github.com/dsopas/MindAPI/pulls) from the
infosec community.
